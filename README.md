# Spam-Mail-Prediction-Project

## Spam Mail Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project implements a Machine Learning based system to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language Processing techniques.  

## Problem Statement  
Spam emails pose security risks and reduce productivity. This project aims to automatically identify spam emails using Machine Learning.  

## Solution Approach  
The project uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert email text into numerical features and Logistic Regression for classification.
